Vitest is a fantastic testing framework. I encourage you to explore it on your own in their [Guide](https://vitest.dev/guide/) and [API](https://vitest.dev/api/) documentation. Those will give you extra tools to test virtually anything but the testing fundamentals you've just learned will last you forever.
